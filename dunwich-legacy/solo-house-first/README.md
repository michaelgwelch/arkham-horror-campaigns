# Solo Play - Starting with The House Always Wins

This folder will contain my two-person solo games that "mirrors" the play of the full group. I'm starting with the same decks of Zoey and Jenny that Matt and I are using in full group. I plan to try to keep the decks similar but based on earned XP this won't always be possible.
